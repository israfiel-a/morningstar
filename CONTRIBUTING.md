- **Code must be functional**: The code pushed must have some kind of purpose.
- **Code must be formatted**: The code must be formatted in accordance with the `.clang-format` file inside `Program/`. This also means the code should follow all naming conventions defined throughout the codebase.
- **Code must be yours**: The code pushed may not be copyrighted by any party, unless under a license that specifically allows use in other projects (without the same license! No GPL-3!). If under said kind of license, please credit the authors and give source information.
